By analyzing historical customer data, we were able to identify key factors contributing to churn and build a predictive model with 85% accuracy.\n\n## Key Achievements\n\n- Processed and analyzed a dataset of 50,000 customer records\n- Implemented feature engineering techniques to improve model performance\n- Utilized Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms for prediction\n- Deployed the model as a web service for real-time predictions\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Python\n- Pandas for data manipulation\n- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms\n- Flask for API development\n- Docker for containerization\n\n## Impact\n\nThe model helped the company reduce churn by 20% over six months, resulting in an estimated $2 million in retained revenue.\n"
