# Copy of Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model to classify customer reviews for an e-commerce platform. The model can determine whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Key Achievements

- Preprocessed and tokenized over 100,000 customer reviews
- Implemented both traditional machine learning (Naive Bayes) and deep learning (BERT) approaches
- Achieved 91% accuracy with the BERT model
- Created a dashboard for real-time sentiment monitoring

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK for text preprocessing
- Hugging Face Transformers for BERT implementation
- Streamlit for dashboard creation

## Impact

The sentiment analysis tool has helped the e-commerce platform improve its customer service response time by 30% and increase customer satisfaction scores by 15%.
