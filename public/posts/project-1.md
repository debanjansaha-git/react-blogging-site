# Machine Learning for Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. By analyzing historical customer data, we were able to identify key factors contributing to churn and build a predictive model with 85% accuracy.

## Key Achievements

- Processed and analyzed a dataset of 50,000 customer records
- Implemented feature engineering techniques to improve model performance
- Utilized Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms for prediction
- Deployed the model as a web service for real-time predictions

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Flask for API development
- Docker for containerization

## Impact

The model helped the company reduce churn by 20% over six months, resulting in an estimated $2 million in retained revenue.
