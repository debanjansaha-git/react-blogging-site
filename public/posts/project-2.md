# Deep Learning for Image Classification

## Project Overview

This project involved building a deep learning model for classifying images of different dog breeds. The model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 images spanning 120 different dog breeds.

## Key Achievements

- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras
- Achieved 92% accuracy on the test set
- Utilized data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization
- Deployed the model as a mobile app for real-time breed identification

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning
- OpenCV for image preprocessing
- Flutter for mobile app development

## Impact

The resulting mobile app has been downloaded over 50,000 times and has an average rating of 4.7 stars on the App Store.
